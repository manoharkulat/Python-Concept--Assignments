    "#1. What is the name of the feature responsible for generating Regex objects?\n",
    "#Solution_1: The re.compile() function returns regex objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "#2. Why do raw strings often appear in Regex objects?\n",
    "#Solution_2:Raw strings are used so that backslashes do not have to be escaped.\n",
    "\n",
    "#3. What is the return value of the search() method?\n",
    "#Solution_3:The search() method returns Match objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "#4. From a Match item, how do you get the actual strings that match the pattern?\n",
    "#Solution_4: The group() method returns strings of the matched text.\n",
    "\n",
    "#5. In the regex which created from the r'(\\d\\d\\d)-(\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d)', what does group zero cover?\n",
    "#Group 2? Group 1?\n",
    "#Solution_5: Group 0 is the entire match,group 1 covers the first set of parentheses, and group 2 covers thr second set of\n",
    "#parentheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "#6. In standard expression syntax, parentheses and intervals have distinct meanings. How can you tell\n",
    "#a regex that you want it to fit real parentheses and periods?\n",
    "#Solution_6: Periods and parentheses can be escaped with a backslash:\\.,\\(,and\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "#7. The findall() method returns a string list or a list of string tuples. What causes it to return one of\n",
    "#the two options?\n",
    "#Solution_7:If the regex has no groups, a list of strings is returned. If the regex has groups, a list of tuples of strings\n",
    "#is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "#8. In standard expressions, what does the | character mean?\n",
    "#Solution_8:The | character signifies matching \"either, or \"between two groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "#9. In regular expressions, what does the character ? stand for?\n",
    "#Solution_9:The ? character can either mean \"match zero or one of the preceding group\" or be used to signify nongreedy matching.\n",
    "\n",
    "#10.In regular expressions, what is the difference between the + and * characters?\n",
    "#Solution_10:The + matches one or mare. The * matches zero or more.\n",
    "\n",
    "#11. What is the difference between {4} and {4,5} in regular expression?\n",
    "#Solution_11:The {4} matches exactly four instances of the preceding group.The {4,5} matches between four and five instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#12. What do you mean by the \\d, \\w, and \\s shorthand character classes signify in regular\n",
    "#expressions?\n",
    "#Solution_12:The \\d,\\w,and\\s shorthand character classes match a single digit, word,or space character, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "#13. What do means by \\D, \\W, and \\S shorthand character classes signify in regular expressions?\n",
    "#Solution_13:The \\D,\\W,and \\S shorthand characters classes match a single character that is not a digit, word or \n",
    "#space character,respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "#14. What is the difference between . and .*?\n",
    "#Solution_14:The . performs a greedy match, and the .? performs a nongreedy match.\n",
    "\n",
    "#15. What is the syntax for matching both numbers and lowercase letters with a character class?\n",
    "#Solution_15:Either [0-9a-z] or [a-z0-9]\n",
    "\n",
    "#16. What is the procedure for making a normal expression in regax case insensitive?\n",
    "#Solution_16:Passing re.| or re.IGNORECASE as the second argument to re.compile() will make the matching case insensitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "#17. What does the . character normally match? What does it match if re.DOTALL is passed as 2nd\n",
    "#argument in re.compile()?\n",
    "#Solution_17:The . character normally matches any character except the newline character.If re.DOTALL is passed as the \n",
    "#second argument to re.compile(), then the dot will also match newline characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "#18. If numReg = re.compile(r'\\d+'), what will numRegex.sub('X', 11 drummers, 10 pipers, five rings, 4 hen) return?\n",
    "#Solution_18: 'X drummers,X pipers,five rings,X hens'\n",
    "\n",
    "#19. What does passing re.VERBOSE as the 2nd argument to re.compile() allow to do?\n",
    "#Solution_19: The re.VERBOSE argument allows you to add whitespace and comments to the string passed to re.compile().\n",

    "#'1234'(which lacks commas)\n",
    "#Solution_20: re.complie(r'^\\d{1,3}(,\\d{3})*$') will create this regex, but other regex strings can produce a similar\n",
    "#regular expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "#21. How would you write a regex that matches the full name of someone whose last name is\n",
    "#Watanabe? You can assume that the first name that comes before it will always be one word that\n",
    "#begins with a capital letter. The regex must match the following:\n",
